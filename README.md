# LimeSurvey Docker

Dockerfile to build a [LimeSurvey](https://limesurvey.org) Image for the Docker container platform.

# Using the apache image

The apache image comes with an Apache Webserver and PHP installed.

# Apache Configuration

To change to Apache Webserver configuration, mount a Volume into the Container at:

 - /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

See the example configuration provided.

# Using the fpm image

To use the fpm image, you need an additional web server that can proxy http-request to the fpm-port of the container. See *docker-compose.fpm.yml* for example.

# Using the fpm image with https
If you would like to run the fpm setup with https, you can get a free certificate from Letsencrypt. As an example, the configuration in *docker-compose.fpm-certbot.yml*
will take care of getting a certificate and installing it. Please note that you will have to adjust the domain name in the file *examples/nginx-certbot.conf* to match
the domain used in the *HOSTNAMES* variable in the docker-compose configuration file. If you added both the a domain and the hostname *www* within the domain,
*nginx-certbot.conf* needs to contain the domain without the hostname. E.g. if you set *"HOSTNAMES=example.org www.example.org"*, the path in *nginx-certbot.conf* needs
to contain *example.org*.

# Using an external database

LimeSurvey requires an external database (MySQL, PostgreSQL) to run. See *docker-compose.yml* for example.

# Persistent data

To preserve the uploaded files assign the upload folder into a volume. See *docker-compose.yml* for example.

Path: */var/www/html/upload/surveys*

**Hint**: The mounted directory must be owned by the webserver user (e.g. www-data)

# LimeSurvey Configuration

The entrypoint will create a new config.php if none is provided and run the LimeSurvey command line interface for installation.

**Hint**: Changing the *ADMIN_* configuration has no effect after the initial configuration. It's best to do this within the application.

To change to LimeSurvey configuration, you can mount a Volume into the Container at:

 - /my-data/config.php:/var/www/html/application/config/config.php

**Hint**: If this configuration is present before the installation, the LimeSurvey Web Installer will not run automatically.

## Data Encryption

LimeSurvey 4 supports data encryption, this image give you these options:

* Provide a security.php file directly (volume)
* Provide encryption keys for the security.php file (environment variables)
* Provide nothing and get a non-persistent security.php file

For further details on the settings see: https://manual.limesurvey.org/Data_encryption

# Running this image with docker-compose

The easiest way to get a fully featured and functional setup is using a docker-compose file. Several examples are provided in the [repository](https://github.com/martialblog/docker-limesurvey)

```
docker-compose up

# Frontend
http://localhost:8080/

# Backend
http://localhost:8080/index.php/admin
```
